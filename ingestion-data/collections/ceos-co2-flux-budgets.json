  "description": "This dataset (Byrne et al. 2022) is described by Byrne et al. (2023) and consists of:\n- Top-down annual net land-atmosphere CO2 fluxes (NCE) from an ensemble of atmospheric CO2 inversions.\n- Bottom-up estimates of fossil fuel emissions and lateral carbon fluxes due to crop trade, wood trade, and river export.\n- Annual changes (loss) in terrestrial carbon stocks (ΔCloss) obtained by combining top-down and bottom-up estimates. In addition, two metrics are provided to help users interpret country-level data: The Z-statistics, which characterizes the differences between top-down NCE estimates.\n- The Fractional Uncertainty Reduction (FUR), which characterizes the impact of assimilated CO2 data on reducing NCE uncertainties.\n- These data are provided for the period 2015-2020 on both a global grid and as country-level totals with error characterization. Figures 1 and 2 illustrates how these carbon fluxes relate to each other and the methodology is described in more detail below.\n",
