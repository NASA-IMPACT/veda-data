    "description": "The global Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) non-stationarity index integrates the trend, seasonal shifts, and variability change of TWS for the period of 2003 - 2020. TWS is derived by jointly assimilating the MODIS Leaf Area Index, the ESA CCI surface soil moisture, and the GSFC GRACE mascon-based TWS anomalies into the Noah-MP land surface model within the NASA Land Information System (LIS) at 10 km spatial resolution forced by the combination of MERRA2 and IMERG meteorological fields. The smaller the non-stationarity index is, the more the water cycle is under a non-stationary process. Glaciers and Greenland are excluded from the analysis.",
