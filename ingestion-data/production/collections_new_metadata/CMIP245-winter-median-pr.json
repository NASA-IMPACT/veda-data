    "description": "Percent difference in projected winter (January, February, March) cumulative precipitation, relative to a historical timeframe between 1995 and 2014. Outputs represent the median of 23 member ensembles from CMIP6 (SSP 2-4.5) with downscaling performed by NASA Earth Exchange \n\n ### Technical Details \n\n Future changes to precipitation are expected to alter the volume and timing of snow water resources. Here, we present the projected percent-change to Western US cumulative winter precipitation at quarter-degree spatial resoutions across 20-year time periods between 2016 and 2095. Projections are averaged from an ensemble of 23 downscaled climate models from the CMIP6 NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections.",
